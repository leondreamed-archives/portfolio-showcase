# Areas Of Exploration

## Readers, writers and texts



<!--
  Briefly answer the following questions:
  Why and how do we study language and literature?
  How are we affected by texts in various ways?
  In what ways is meaning constructed, negotiated, expressed and interpreted?
  How does language use vary amongst text types and amongst literary forms?
  How does the structure or style of a text affect meaning?
  How do texts offer insights and challenges?
-->


<!-- Write about How Poems See, How Poems Sound -->

## Time and space

<!-- How important is cultural or historical context to the production and reception of a text?​ -->

When reading texts, we need to consider the cultural and historical context in order to better understand the writer's intentions. In our course, a good example of a text that benefits from an understanding of the cultural and historical context is Things Fall Apart. Chinua Achebe wrote *Things Fall Apart* in response to the way European literature depicted African culture, especially in Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*.

<!-- To what extent do texts offer insight into another culture? -->

Things Fall Apart also gives the reader insight into African culture from a post-colonial lens. In Things Fall Apart, the reader learns about African culture from the inside. The reader is exposed to African traditions and beliefs from a clan member's point of view, and gains a new perspective on how Europeans were viewed from the context of an African clan.

## Intertextuality

Intertextuality deals with the relationship between different texts. In our course, one text that alluded to multiple other texts was *The Songlines* by Bruce Chatwin. In the extract that we used for a practice Paper 2, Chatwin discusses his thoughts about the nature of human restlessness. When offering alternative perpsectives, he alludes to *Pensées*, a work written by the philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal, who offers a hypothesis based on philosophy, concluding that human restlessness is a negative characteristic. After expanding on Pascal's explanation, Chatwin offers an alternative perspective based on scientific evidence. By referencing Pascal's work, Chatwin exposes the reader to multiple different intepretations of the topic, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the issue.

# IB Concepts

<!-- see https://www.cambridge.org/us/education/blog/2019/07/25/7-key-concepts-english-language-and-literature-ib-diploma/ -->

## Identity

<!-- To what extent is a text an expression of a writer’s identity? Do readers like characters who are thinly veiled versions of themselves? Do strong characters challenge readers to be someone different? By analysing texts, we are really analysing who we are and what we want to become. -->

The IB concept of identity is prevelant in Persepolis, an autobiographical graphic novel detailing Marjane Satrapi's childhood in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. The protagonist in the novel is based off of the author, Marjane, and is written in a honest way reflective of people in the real-world. In this way, readers are able to relate with the main character and feel closely connected with them. In addition, the reader is able to see Marjane grow as a person throughout the novel.

<img class='mx-auto' src='/assets/persepolis-panel.png' width='400' />

# Image 1

In this panel, Satrapi creates a contrast between religious beliefs and modern beliefs. The panel contains narration, where Satrapi describes her self-conflict about the veil. She discusses how there are two parts of herself which are in conflict with each other: while she is deep down a very religion person, her family was very modern and avant-garde, which means that they favour experimental and unusual ideas. These parts of herself are in conflict because religion is ultimately tied to tradition and is often hesitant to change, rejecting experimental and unusual ideas in favour of traditional ideas.

Satrapi also uses the visual medium of the comic to convey this conflict. The left side of the panel contains gears and tools, symbols that represent science, a subject which is concrete and based on proof and objectivity. In contrast, the right side of the panel contains a very abstract drawing, which is a symbol for religion, a subject which is very abstract and relies on faith and often interpretation. In addition, both of these halves are equal in size, which emphasizes how the narrator was extremely divided about these topics, and didn't know which side of herself she should prefer.

In addition, Satrapi also draws herself wearing two different outfits on the different halves of the panel. On the left side, she draws herself without the veil, representing the modern side of her family. On the right side, she draws herself wearing the veil, representing her side which was very religious. The salient image in this panel is her face, as it is the only part of the image that doesn't change between the two halves. The expression on her face is significant because it doesn't display any visiblly strong emotion, indicating that this conflict is primarily a personal and internal conflict.

## Culture

<!--
  Things Fall Apart
-->

Texts can give the reader insight into different cultures. One of the texts we read in class which introduced us to a different culture is "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe. Throughout this novel, Achebe introduces us to Igbo culture. Within the culture, there are certain gender roles that prevail throughout the novel, especially the role of women in Umuofia.

In Umuofia, the role of women is to take care of the family. We can see this in Okonkwo’s household, where the women are responsible for looking after the children and cooking the food for the family. In addition, women are portrayed as almost “secondary characters,” as if they’re there to support the male in the family.

In addition, an interesting gender role reversal is Chielo, who is the priestess of the Oracle of the Hills and Caves. She is the one who the clan listens to for advice, in contrast to the other women who usually rely on the males for advice.

In addition, for women, it is their “crown and jewel” to raise a child, whereas for men it is the valour and strength that distinguishes them.

## Creativity

A text we read in our course that is representative of creativity is "The Affair" by Alan Riddell:

<img src='/assets/the-affair.png' width='300' />

This is an unconventional poem as it is a "Poem Without Words." Yet, it still is able to convey meaning to the reader. Here is my interpretation:

I think this poem is about a relationship between a man and a woman. I read the poem left to right, top to bottom. Through this method of reading, the speaker initially uses only the letter “i”, which likely refers to the pronoun “i” that represents the speaker alone. In the next line, the speaker introduces a letter “u” in the middle of the line, which likely represents the female that the speaker encounters. In the next few lines, there are many more “u”s which symbolize the female being more present in the speaker’s life. However, near the middle of the poem, the number of “u”s starts to decrease, potentially symbolizing that the female starts becoming more distant from the speaker. Finally, in the last line, there is only the letter “i”s again, likely indicating that the speaker is once again alone and without the woman in her life. Based on the title, it likely represents a short-lived affair between a man and a woman. And when the poem is looked as at a whole, the letter u’s form both a diamond, or a square missing a center (depending on how you look at it). If the shape is interpreted as a square missing a center, this “missing” part of the square could represent a “hole” in the speaker’s life now that the woman has left him. If the shape is interpreted as a diamond, since diamonds generally represent riches, it could possibly mean that the woman, the “u”, was wealthy compared to the speaker, and could be the reason why the woman eventually left him.

Here's my take on a Poem Without Words:

## Communication

Communcation deals with the connection between readers, writers, and texts.

## Perspective

Perspective refers to the ability for texts to offer the reader a novel pespective on life. One poem that relates to this concept is "Whispers of Immortality" by T.S. Eliot. Here is an extract from the poem:

<pre>
Donne, I suppose, was such another
Who found no substitute for sense;
To seize and clutch and penetrate,
Expert beyond experience,

He knew the anguish of the marrow
The ague of the skeleton;
No contact possible to flesh
Allayed the fever of the bone.
</pre>

In these lines, Eliot discusses how Donne understood death and came to accept it as a part of life, and thus he sought to survive and find his own light in a world of darkness; a world where death is inevitable and is the ultimate end to everyone.

I connected these lines to a poem written by John Donne titled “Death, be not proud.” In his poem, Donne talks about how he is not afraid of death, and that death should not be something to fear. He personifies death in his poem, as he tells it “Death, be not proud, though some have called thee / Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so.” This aligns with Eliot’s description of Donne, who he says has accepted the reality of death and instead of worrying about it, Donne instead seeks to live to his fullest in spite of this seemingly bitter end.

The theme of surviving and finding light in a world of darkness is present in The Swimmer. The main character, Neddy, is avoiding the ultimate realization of his inhospitable circumstances and instead tries to find meaning for himself. At the end of the novel, however, “looking in at the windows, [he] saw that the place was empty.” Neddy is ultimately faced with reality and has to accept his circumstances. Neddy looking through the windows and finding the place empty is similar to Donne realizing that death is a part of oneself and unavoidable. In a sense, Donne looked through the window of life to find death and a world of darkness. However, instead of trying to avoid the darkness in the world like Neddy had done, Donne has seemingly accepted it and instead uses it to his advantage by engaging with the world and making the most of his experiences while he can. For Neddy, he finds light in his world of darkness by avoiding the darkness, while Donne finds light in his world of darkness by embracing it.

Eliot talks about how death is a part of life, referring to it as “the fever of the bone.” He mentions how “no contact possible to flesh” can delay this fever, with “contact to flesh” referencing love and romantic relationships. Through these lines, Eliot seems to establish a meaningless world, where death is unavoidable and is everybody’s ultimate fate, and not even love can bring meaning into the world.

<img src="/assets/whispers-of-immortality-bone.png" />

To symbolize Eliot’s depiction of a meaningless world, I’ve drawn a representation of the “fever of the bone.” This image depicts the fever both physically (by having a bone in bed with a thermometer in his mouth), and also metaphorically (with the “love” medicine on top the drawer). The almost-empty container of “love medicine” indicates that it had already been heavily used to no avail. This aligns with the idea that “no contact possible to flesh / allayed the fever of the bone,” as no use of the medicine, in this case, love, would heal the fever of death. I’ve also drawn a clock to symbolize time passing, that this “fever of the bone” occurs throughout our lifetime and is always with us from our birth.

The idea of a meaningless world can also be found in A Doll House by Henrik Ibsen. In Ibsen’s play, Nora feels like she’s living in an unsatisfactory marriage. In Act 3, Nora tells Torvald that she’d lived with Torvald “like a beggar, just from hand to mouth.” She feels like she’s treated as a doll as if her life was meaningless. Thus, she takes the step in leaving her marriage in pursuit of a more fulfilling life. Nora says that she has “to stand completely alone, if [she’s] ever going to discover [herself] and the world out there.” This is similar to how John Donne has realized the meaningless world where death is the only ending, and how he strives to find meaning in his world despite this.

# Fields of Inquiry

## Culture, identity, and community

A text we read in class that represents culture, identity, and community is the short story "Blankets" by Sherman Alexie. The blankets in the story are a metaphor for many different ideas, including the role of nostalgia in one's identity and the shared values in the community of First Nations.

**The blankets in the story certainly serve a perfectly normal function, but they're also highly symbolic. What do you think the blankets in the story represent?**

In the story, blankets symbolize protection and comfort. In line 20, the author uses the term "uninsured and unblanketed." Here, blanket refers to the idea of protection, similar to the purpose of insurance. In line 66, the author also uses the term blanket to refer to nostalgia, describing how a woman "had taken nostalgia as her false idol—her thin blanket—and it was murdering her." In this case, the blanket symbolizes how the woman was seeking comfort in nostalgia, how she wished for things to return back to a previous state. However, the author describes the blanket as thin, or in other words, it wasn't doing her much good.

When the author gives his blanket to his father, who then starts to sing, the blanket then symbolizes restoration and faith. The "magical" quality of the blanket being able to heal others is similar to how blankets are able to keep us warm during the night or the cold. In other words, just like how blankets help us get through cold and harsh weather, the symbol of blankets in the story is that faith and song is able to help the author's father get through dark times.

In addition, blankets are also representative of community. In the same way that blankets are often shared between multiple (close) people, the blankets in the story could also symbolize the connection between the tribes.

## Art, creativity, and the imagination

One text we encountered in class that showcases art, creativity, and the imagination was the graphic text "In the Shadow of No Towers" by Art Spiegelman.

**Summarize the literal content of the poem, noting any interesting shifts in tone, structure, or subject matter.**

The graphic text, named “In the Shadow of No Towers,” introduces several different panels indicating various American responses to the 9/11 attacks. In the top left panel, an American family is initially seen asleep in front of the television, and then suddenly becoming shocked at what they see (presumably coverage of the 9/11 attacks). However, in the following panel, they are seen back asleep, but with their hair still frazzled, indicating that only a short time has passed between the second panel and the third. It’s interesting to note that the calendar is covered by an American flag. Below these panels, there is a small series of panels that explain the origin and the definition of the idiom “waiting for the other shoe to drop,” which is used in the bottom middle panel with a shoe falling onto people. Based on the panel, waiting for the other shoe to drop means waiting for an inevitable event to occur that proceeds after an initial event. Below that panel, there is a commentary about how on television, the Twin Towers seem much smaller than they really are. On the sides of the graphic text, there are the two towers and commentary from two different people about the Twin Towers.

**Compose a focus (thesis) statement that addresses on the poem's connections to shared human experience.**

Through the use of symbols, the combination of text and images, and the position and size of the panels in his graphic text “In the Shadow of No Towers,” Art Spiegelman successfully uses the graphic medium to represent and critique the various responses of the American public to the events of 9/11.

**Annotate the poem, noting how the author's structural and stylistic choices (e.g., sound devices, diction, metaphor, etc.) help shape meaning and effect.**

In this graphic text, Art Spiegelman uses symbols, the combination of text and images, and the position and size of the panels to express different American responses to the 9/11 attacks. The symbol of a shoe is prevalent through this text, and it is representative of how loud and controversial news and/or events are considered “normal,” whereas quieter and less controversial events are less well-received. In the comic about the shoe, the noise from dropping the initial shoe doesn’t receive any attention, indicating that it is the expectation. However, when the man silently puts down his other shoe, we can see that the other people in the house are furious with him, expecting him to drop the other shoe. The symbol of the shoe is then repeated at the bottom of the text, where a giant shoe created by “Jihad brand footware” is falling on a crowd of people. In one interpretation, this shoe represents an inevitable event that is expected from the public, which is supported by the series of panels from the right where somebody is worried about a new disaster. This emphasizes how the 9/11 attacks created panic and worry after they occurred.

---

In addition to the symbol of the shoe, Spiegelman uses the combination of text with the images to better introduce certain ideas. In the panel about the news, he uses the text to provide context for the non-sequitur panels. Through this mini-comic, Spiegelman criticizes the news for failing to depict the event in its true nature. In the last panel, we can see a man staring at the television filled with the US flag and failing to notice the plane crashing into the plane. This is symbolic of how the news fails to properly depict the event.
