# Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio showcase! This portfolio showcase is a curation of the various works I have completed throughout Year 1 and Year 2 of IB English ranging from your typical text analysis to drawings and fictional letters.

> Fun fact, this portfolio showcase was created using code! (The link to the source code can be found on the last page.) Now that I've found a way to use programming to complete an English assignment, I have successfully completed my personal challenge of incorporating programming into every academic subject! :)

My relationship with English is a bit complicated. As somebody who's planning on pursuing software development (if it wasn't already obvious), English isn't exactly the subject that first comes to mind as a skill you want to have, as indicated by this humorous quote I stumbled across one day:

"Throughout my academic career, I'd given some pretty good talks. But being considered the best speaker in the Computer Science department is like being known as the tallest of the Seven Dwarfs." — _The Last Lecture_, a book by Jeffrey Zaslow and Randy Pausch

However, in addition to software development, I'm also planning on pursuing entrepreneurship, and a crucial skill that entrepreneurs need is communication. Entrepreneurs need to be able to effectively express their ideas and visions for their company to potential investors or customers, and fluency in English plays a large role with this.

Typically, communication (especially when it comes to presentations and public speaking) hasn't been my strongest area, and that's why it's been my main area of focus throughout the last four years of English courses.

Of course, communication doesn't just include verbal communication, but also written communication, which composes the majority of my work showcased in this learner's portfolio. For some types of assignments, you might find that my communication is decently effective and somewhat concise. And for others...let's just say there's definitely room for improvement.

In any case, I hope you enjoy browsing through my portfolio showcase!

# Areas Of Exploration

## Readers, writers and texts

<!-- Write about How Poems See, How Poems Sound -->

In English class, we listened to Episodes I and II of the CBC Great Poetry Series. Episode I, _How Poems Sound_, discussed how the structure of poems can influence meaning and interpretation. For example, in poetry, there are different meters which can influence the tone of the poem:

**Trochaic**: heavy tone, tends to reflect stuff not about life (e.g. elegy (death and grief))
\
**Anapestic**: to hit back (usually threatening)
\
**Bacchic**: celebration (waltz, drinking, etc.)

Episode II, _How Poems See_, discuss the use of literary devices like metaphors, similes, and imagery in poems to construct a vivid image in the reader's mind. In this episode, the host discussed a school of poetry that emerged in the 1980s known as Martianism. The point of a lot of these poems was to "make the familiar strange." In addition to Martianism, there was also a movement known as Imagism, which was an attempt to revitalize poetry by avoiding the use of similes, metaphors, symbols, and anything that was complex; the poems would create tension out of the juxtaposing of images.

## Time and space

<!-- How important is cultural or historical context to the production and reception of a text?​ -->

When reading texts, we need to consider the cultural and historical context in order to better understand the writer's intentions. In our course, a good example of a text that benefits from an understanding of the cultural and historical context is _Things Fall Apart_. In class, we learned that Chinua Achebe wrote _Things Fall Apart_ in response to the way European literature depicted African culture, especially in Joseph Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_.

<!-- To what extent do texts offer insight into another culture? -->

Things Fall Apart also gives the reader insight into African culture from a post-colonial lens. In Things Fall Apart, the reader learns about African culture from the inside. The reader is exposed to African traditions and beliefs from a clan member's point of view, and gains a new perspective on how Europeans were viewed from the context of an African clan.

## Intertextuality

Intertextuality deals with the relationship between different texts. In our course, one text that alluded to multiple other texts was _The Songlines_ by Bruce Chatwin. In the extract that we used for a practice Paper 2, Chatwin discusses his thoughts about the nature of human restlessness. When offering alternative perpsectives, he alludes to _Pensées_, a work written by the philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal, who offers a hypothesis based on philosophy, concluding that human restlessness is a negative characteristic. After expanding on Pascal's explanation, Chatwin offers an alternative perspective based on scientific evidence. By referencing Pascal's work, Chatwin exposes the reader to multiple different intepretations of the topic, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the issue.

# IB Concepts

<!-- see https://www.cambridge.org/us/education/blog/2019/07/25/7-key-concepts-english-language-and-literature-ib-diploma/ -->

## Identity

<!-- To what extent is a text an expression of a writer’s identity? Do readers like characters who are thinly veiled versions of themselves? Do strong characters challenge readers to be someone different? By analysing texts, we are really analysing who we are and what we want to become. -->

The IB concept of identity is prevelant in Persepolis, an autobiographical graphic novel detailing Marjane Satrapi's childhood in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. The protagonist in the novel is based off of the author, Marjane, and is written in a honest way reflective of people in the real-world. In this way, readers are able to relate with the main character and feel closely connected with them. In addition, the reader is able to see Marjane grow as a person throughout the novel. The following panel is one example of how the reader is able to connect with Satrapi:

<img class='mx-auto' src='/assets/persepolis-panel.png' width='400' />

In this panel, Satrapi creates a contrast between religious beliefs and modern beliefs. The panel contains narration, where Satrapi describes her self-conflict about the veil. She discusses how there are two parts of herself which are in conflict with each other: while she is deep down a very religion person, her family was very modern and avant-garde, which means that they favour experimental and unusual ideas. These parts of herself are in conflict because religion is ultimately tied to tradition and is often hesitant to change, rejecting experimental and unusual ideas in favour of traditional ideas.

Satrapi also uses the visual medium of the comic to convey this conflict. The left side of the panel contains gears and tools, symbols that represent science, a subject which is concrete and based on proof and objectivity. In contrast, the right side of the panel contains a very abstract drawing, which is a symbol for religion, a subject which is very abstract and relies on faith and often interpretation. In addition, both of these halves are equal in size, which emphasizes how the narrator was extremely divided about these topics, and didn't know which side of herself she should prefer.

In addition, Satrapi also draws herself wearing two different outfits on the different halves of the panel. On the left side, she draws herself without the veil, representing the modern side of her family. On the right side, she draws herself wearing the veil, representing her side which was very religious. The salient image in this panel is her face, as it is the only part of the image that doesn't change between the two halves. The expression on her face is significant because it doesn't display any visiblly strong emotion, indicating that this conflict is primarily a personal and internal conflict.

## Culture

<!--
  Things Fall Apart
-->

Texts can give the reader insight into different cultures. One of the texts we read in class which introduced us to a different culture is "Things Fall Apart" by Chinua Achebe. Throughout this novel, Achebe introduces us to Igbo culture.

In class, we discussed about Achebe's motivation for writing _Things Fall Apart_. Here are some of the point-form notes I took:

- Achebe wanted to write Things Fall Apart to describe his people and to highlight the contact between one culture and another.
- Achebe wanted the story to be “true” even though it’s fiction
- Achebe had parents who were converts and missionaries
- He felt that something about the Igbo religion was left out
- There are universal things that other people can “hit upon” when you told a specific story that relates to a universal theme

Within Igbo culture specifically, there are certain gender roles that prevail throughout the novel, especially the role of women in Umuofia.

In Umuofia, the role of women is to take care of the family. We can see this in Okonkwo’s household, where the women are responsible for looking after the children and cooking the food for the family. Women are portrayed as almost “secondary characters,” as if they’re there to support the male in the family.

In addition, for women, it is their “crown and jewel” to raise a child, whereas for men it is the valour and strength that distinguishes them.

However, an interesting gender role reversal in the novel is Chielo, who is the priestess of the Oracle of the Hills and Caves. She is the one who the clan listens to for advice, in contrast to the other women who usually rely on the males for advice.

## Creativity

A text we read in our course that is representative of creativity is "The Affair" by Alan Riddell.
"The Affair" is an unconventional poem as it is a "Poem Without Words." Yet, it still is able to convey meaning to the reader. Here is my interpretation:

<div class='mt-4'>
  <img src='/assets/the-affair.png' class='float-left mr-5' width='300' />

  <p class='!mt-0'>
    I think this poem is about a relationship between a man and a woman. I read the poem left to right, top to bottom. Through this method of reading, the speaker initially uses only the letter “i”, which likely refers to the pronoun “i” that represents the speaker alone. In the next line, the speaker introduces a letter “u” in the middle of the line, which likely represents the female that the speaker encounters. In the next few lines, there are many more “u”s which symbolize the female being more present in the speaker’s life. However, near the middle of the poem, the number of “u”s starts to decrease, potentially symbolizing that the female starts becoming more distant from the speaker. Finally, in the last line, there is only the letter “i”s again, likely indicating that the speaker is once again alone and without the woman in her life. Based on the title, it likely represents a short-lived affair between a man and a woman. And when the poem is looked as at a whole, the letter u’s form both a diamond, or a square missing a center (depending on how you look at it). If the shape is interpreted as a square missing a center, this “missing” part of the square could represent a “hole” in the speaker’s life now that the woman has left him. If the shape is interpreted as a diamond, since diamonds generally represent riches, it could possibly mean that the woman, the “u”, was wealthy compared to the speaker, and could be the reason why the woman eventually left him.

## Communication

Communication deals with the connection between readers, writers, and texts. In Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_, Mary Shelley alludes to Milton's poem, "Paradise Lost," which discusses Adam and Eve's fall from grace after eating the Forbidden Fruit. We had an opportunity in class to discuss the relationship between Adam, Victor and the Creature, and here were some of the points I brought up:

**Does Adam best resemble Victor or the Creature? Explain.**

Even though Adam and the Creature were both created by a creator, their circumstances are quite different. The Creature initially did nothing wrong to get rejected by society, whereas Adam had disobeyed God and thus was punished because of it. Thus, I believe it’s more appropriate to compare Adam to Victor.

Adam laments his decision to accept the terms of Paradise, as he says that he should have been refused
the terms of Paradise. As he accepted it, it would be unreasonable for him to enjoy Paradise and then make objections towards the conditions that came with it. In the same way, we can make a connection in Frankenstein with Paradise representing life and Adam representing Victor. Victor had foolishly played with life for his own interest. He had dismissed the conditions that came with the power to bestow life. When it didn’t turn out the way he wanted, it was unreasonable of him to simply shrug it off without dealing with the consequences of his careless actions. Just like how Adam regrets accepting the terms of Paradise, Victor now regrets accepting the implicit terms that came with bestowing life, as he refuses to share the secret to life with Walton which led to his “destruction and infallible misery.” (Shelley 35)

Another similarity between Victor and Adam is that they both wish for death to be their punishment. Adam wishes for God to punish him by turning him back into dust. He is angry at God that his death will not suffice as his punishment. In Frankenstein, we also see Victor wishing for his death. During the time he was imprisoned on the island after being convicted of Clerval’s murder, he asks himself: “Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest?” (Shelley 145) Victor mentions how it was unfair for death to snatch away the lives of innocent kids but it refused to take away the life of somebody as miserable as he was. Likewise, Adam believes that somebody deserving of punishment as him should be subject to death instead of a punishment involving the suffering of other innocent people.

We can notice a resemblance between Adam and the forbidden fruit and Victor and the forbidden knowledge: the knowledge of creating life. In Paradise Lost, Adam laments his situation as his sins cause others to suffer, saying “Who of all ages to succeed, but, feeling the evil on him brought by me, will curse my head? Ill fare our ancestor impure, for this we may thank Adam!” Adam feels that he would be blamed by his ancestors for their punishment brought on by his sins. We can see Victor feeling the same guilt as Adam, blaming himself for all the crimes that the monster committed. Similar to Adam, Victor felt guilty for the consequences that would befall humankind for having created the Creature, and he “felt that [he] has no right to share [man’s] [company] ... they would, each and all, abhor [him] and hunt [him] from the world did they know ... the crimes which had their source in [him]!” (Shelley 152). Both Adam and Victor feel guilty for their sins and feel like they should take full responsibility for the evil that they have brought upon other innocent people.

## Perspective

Perspective refers to the ability for texts to offer the reader a novel pespective on life. One poem that relates to this concept is "Whispers of Immortality" by T.S. Eliot. Here is an extract from the poem:

<div class='column items-center'>
  <p>
    Donne, I suppose, was such another
    <br/>
    Who found no substitute for sense;
    <br/>
    To seize and clutch and penetrate,
    <br/>
    Expert beyond experience,
    </p>
  <p>
    He knew the anguish of the marrow
    <br/>
    The ague of the skeleton;
    <br/>
    No contact possible to flesh
    <br/>
    Allayed the fever of the bone.
  </p>
</div>

In these lines, Eliot discusses how Donne understood death and came to accept it as a part of life, and thus he sought to survive and find his own light in a world of darkness; a world where death is inevitable and is the ultimate end to everyone.

I connected these lines to a poem written by John Donne titled “Death, be not proud.” In his poem, Donne talks about how he is not afraid of death, and that death should not be something to fear. He personifies death in his poem, as he tells it “Death, be not proud, though some have called thee / Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so.” This aligns with Eliot’s description of Donne, who he says has accepted the reality of death and instead of worrying about it, Donne instead seeks to live to his fullest in spite of this seemingly bitter end.

The theme of surviving and finding light in a world of darkness is present in The Swimmer. The main character, Neddy, is avoiding the ultimate realization of his inhospitable circumstances and instead tries to find meaning for himself. At the end of the novel, however, “looking in at the windows, [he] saw that the place was empty.” Neddy is ultimately faced with reality and has to accept his circumstances. Neddy looking through the windows and finding the place empty is similar to Donne realizing that death is a part of oneself and unavoidable. In a sense, Donne looked through the window of life to find death and a world of darkness. However, instead of trying to avoid the darkness in the world like Neddy had done, Donne has seemingly accepted it and instead uses it to his advantage by engaging with the world and making the most of his experiences while he can. For Neddy, he finds light in his world of darkness by avoiding the darkness, while Donne finds light in his world of darkness by embracing it.

Eliot talks about how death is a part of life, referring to it as “the fever of the bone.” He mentions how “no contact possible to flesh” can delay this fever, with “contact to flesh” referencing love and romantic relationships. Through these lines, Eliot seems to establish a meaningless world, where death is unavoidable and is everybody’s ultimate fate, and not even love can bring meaning into the world.

---

<img src="/assets/whispers-of-immortality-bone.png" width='500' class='mx-auto m-4' />

To symbolize Eliot’s depiction of a meaningless world, I’ve drawn a representation of the “fever of the bone.” This image depicts the fever both physically (by having a bone in bed with a thermometer in his mouth), and also metaphorically (with the “love” medicine on top the drawer). The almost-empty container of “love medicine” indicates that it had already been heavily used to no avail. This aligns with the idea that “no contact possible to flesh / allayed the fever of the bone,” as no use of the medicine, in this case, love, would heal the fever of death. I’ve also drawn a clock to symbolize time passing, that this “fever of the bone” occurs throughout our lifetime and is always with us from our birth.

The idea of a meaningless world can also be found in A Doll House by Henrik Ibsen. In Ibsen’s play, Nora feels like she’s living in an unsatisfactory marriage. In Act 3, Nora tells Torvald that she’d lived with Torvald “like a beggar, just from hand to mouth.” She feels like she’s treated as a doll as if her life was meaningless. Thus, she takes the step in leaving her marriage in pursuit of a more fulfilling life. Nora says that she has “to stand completely alone, if [she’s] ever going to discover [herself] and the world out there.” This is similar to how John Donne has realized the meaningless world where death is the only ending, and how he strives to find meaning in his world despite this.

## Transformation

One of the texts that demonstrates transformation is the short story _Ligeia_ written by Edgar Allan Poe. In Grade 11, I wrote an essay about the relationship between the narrative voice in _Ligeia_ and the Transformation of Inner Thought into Outward Action:

<div class='text-[1rem]'>
<p class='text-center'>The Narrative Voice in Ligeia and the Transformation of Inner Thought into Outward Action</p>

Edgar Allen Poe wrote Ligeia using a first-person narrative, where the narrator tells the reader the story of Lady Ligeia from his perspective. The narrator writes about events that took place many years in the past, recalling them from his limited memory. Since he presents himself as an opium addict during the course of the story, he establishes himself as an unreliable narrator. Poe uses an unreliable narrator in many of his short stories, and in Ligeia, the narrator’s lack of credibility widens the possible interpretations of his story. One such interpretation is the message of transformation from inner thought into outward action. Inner thoughts would be limited to the narrator’s mind which have no physical representation. For these thoughts to transform into outward actions, they must lead to events or consequences that occur outside of the narrator’s mind. In Ligeia, Poe explains how inner thought transforms into outward actions by using a first-person narrative voice to emphasize the impact of the narrator’s emotions on his decisions, the consequences of his determination, and his distorted perception of reality.

By telling the story from his perspective, the narrator gives the reader a deeper insight into his thoughts and emotions. The reader is able to observe their influence on his actions. After Ligeia’s death, the narrator moves out of his old city, unwilling to live in constant reminder of his sorrows. He buys an abbey with a gloomy appearance, noting that it “had much in unison with [his] feelings of utter abandonment” (Poe 7). The reader is able to observe how his sorrowful emotions transform into action as they compel him to move to a remote and isolated location in England. These emotions also cause him to depend on opium. Opium is a drug primarily used to suppress pain and can also have the effect of enhancing the mood of the user (Encyclopædia Britannica). The narrator likely turns to opium hoping it would subdue his feelings of grief. Unfortunately, opium is an addictive drug, producing withdrawal symptoms that can only be alleviated by its continued use (Encyclopædia Britannica). The narrator mentions how he becomes “a bounden slave in the trammels of opium” (Poe 8). His attempt to escape his sorrowful emotions only transforms him into a slave of the drug. Yet, despite his efforts, his thoughts for Ligeia remain ever-present and his attempts to evade them only seem to strengthen his determination for her existence.

Throughout the story, the narrator constantly mentions Ligeia, demonstrating his inability to forget about her and his determination for her to live. During his marriage with Lady Rowena and while under the influence of opium, he calls upon Ligeia’s name as if “[he] could restore her to the pathway she had abandoned” (Poe 10). It seems as though the narrator succeeds in his goal. Although it is not explicitly mentioned, the unique narrative voice of Ligeia enables the reader to infer that it is the narrator’s thoughts of Ligeia that ultimately give life to Rowena’s corpse. The narrator uses an anaphora to create this subtle correlation as he recounts how “again [he] sunk into visions of Ligeia --and again, ... again there reached [his] ears a low sob from the region of the ebony bed” (Poe 13). After Rowena’s death, every time the narrator starts thinking about Ligeia, he notices Rowena’s body exhibiting signs of life, eventually resulting in her resurrection as Lady Ligeia. His inability to recover from Ligeia’s death and his ever-growing determination for her to live seems to transform into the outward action of her resurrection.

</div>

<p class='text-center'>Continued on the next page...</p>

---

<div class='text-[1rem]'>

Although it is likely that the events leading up to Ligeia’s resurrection are only hallucinations induced by the narrator’s use of opium, the narrator is ultimately unable to distinguish them from reality. Opium is known to cause visual, auditory, and even tactile hallucinations (ECRI). The narrator’s hallucinations are intense enough to evoke physical reactions. When the narrator witnesses color rushing back into Rowena’s corpse, he “chafe[s] and bathe[s] [its] temples and [its] hands” (Poe 13). His hallucinations appear so convincing to him that they compel him to take action. The narrator also occasionally inserts remarks from the present as he narrates his story, a unique element only found in a first-person narrative. When he writes about the sobs from the bed of Rowena’s corpse, he notes in his writing: “(what marvel that I shudder while I write)” (Poe 13). This remark is given from his present perspective as he reflects on past events. His hallucinations were so intense that they evoke a physical response (his shuddering) even when he reflects on them. The strongest example of how thought transforms into outward action is displayed by the narrator's inability to distinguish between his hallucinations and reality. Through his first-person narrative voice, he reflects on this uncertainty during the time when Rowena was about to drink the cup of wine. The narrator writes that “[he] may have dreamed that [he] saw” ruby-coloured drops fall into the cup, but he considered them at the time likely “the suggestion of a vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady, by the opium, and by the hour” (Poe 11). The narrator acknowledges that his perceptions may have been altered by opium. However, he is still unsure whether the events were a hallucination or not, using words like “may have” in his narrative to indicate his uncertainty. This failure to distinguish between reality and imagination leads to an outward action, as the narrator feels compelled to write out the story of Ligeia in the way he remembers it. Since he cannot discern reality from his hallucinations, he writes out the story of Ligeia without this distinction. This distortion of perception that resulted from his thoughts and passions about Ligeia transformed into the outward action of his writing that the reader can physically observe outside his mind through his first-person account of events.

In conclusion, Poe successfully explains how inner thought and motivation can result in outward action through the narrative voice in Ligeia. The first-person narrative voice reveals how the narrator’s thoughts influence his actions, how his determination leads to physical consequences, and how his emotions alter his perception of reality. Although the story of Ligeia is largely fictional, the transformation of thought into outward action is present in our everyday lives. Inner thought and motivation may not be enough to resurrect the dead, but they do exhibit the power to overcome obstacles and the power to achieve goals as they transform from ideas into reality.

## Representation

Representation deals with how fictional characters can represent reality. I touched on this topic in my individual oral, where I got to refer to Othello and Miss Julie, two fictional works, to explore the global issue of how people in seemingly powerless positions are able to exploit their preferred race and gender to gain power over those in higher positions by influencing their thoughts and actions. Here were some of my bullet points in reference to Othello:

<div class='text-sm'>
- Highest-ranked general, Othello, is tricked by lowest-ranking ensign, Iago, into falsely thinking that his wife is cheating on him
<br />
- In this play, Iago leverages his preferred race & the perpetuated racism towards Othello to gain significant influence over Othello's thoughts and actions
<br />
- In my chosen passage, Iago is convincing Othello of Desdemona’s infidelity
<br />
- In this conversation, Iago has more power, as seen by the em dash on line 3 that indicates that he cuts off Othello
<br />
- This power comes from earlier in the scene, where Iago claimed that because both he and Desdemona were Venetian = he knew things about Desdemona that Othello didn’t
<br />
- Iago exploits his race to gain credibility, causing Othello to believe his claims about Desdemona simply on the basis of his race
<br />
- Through this credibility, Iago starts getting Othello to doubt Desdemona’s loyalty.
<br />
- In lines 1 and 3, Othello uses a nature metaphor to describe his doubts, stating “I do not think but Desdemona’s honest / And yet, how nature erring from itself—”
<br />
- Reference to how good things in nature can sometimes go bad
<br />
- Nature is a metaphor for Desdemona’s loyalty
<br />
- Othello is afraid she might veer away from her loyal nature
<br />
- Iago twists Othello’s definition of Desdemona’s nature; claims Desdemona’s true nature is to be loyal to those of her own race
<br />
- Lines 5 to 7: Desdemona refused those “Of her own clime, complexion, and degree, / Whereto we see in all things nature tends.”
<br />
- Allusion: animals are attracted to those of their own species
<br />
- implies that Othello is of an incompatible “species” for Desdemona due to his skin colour.
<br />
- Also seen in other parts of the play through animal imagery that evokes disgust, e.g. “a daughter covered with a Barbary horse” or Othello as “an old black ram tupping [a] white ewe.”
<br />
- By maliciously associating Othello’s race with nature, Iago is able to establish Othello’s relationship with Desdemona is “unnatural”
<br />
- line 19, where Othello regrets marrying Desdemona, is evidence that this racism influences Othello’s thoughts
<br />
- In addition to nature, Iago implies Othello’s race is less attractive, saying in line 13 that Desdemona would “fall to match [Othello] with her country forms”
<br />
- This racist stereotype is prevalent throughout the play, e.g. Barbantio telling Othello that Desdemona would never “run from her guardage to the sooty bosom / Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.”
<br />
- “sooty” relates Othello’s skin colour to that of dirt, which is universally associated with filth and disgust
<br />
- This racist association with ugliness fills Othello with self-doubt: in line 40, Othello says to himself  “Haply, for I am black,” as a reason for Desdemona’s infidelity, implying that having black skin is a negative characteristic.
<br />
- This self-doubt is symbolized through Iago’s stage actions
<br />
- Thoughts of self-doubt repeatedly enter and exit our minds, just like Iago repeatedly entering and exiting the scene
<br />
- Iago also constantly switches between telling Othello not to worry about it, and telling Othello to stay wary
<br />
- This constant resurfacing of self-doubts is what wears Othello down, who by the end of the scene can be arguing with himself and filled with anger and jealousy
<br />
- In his rage, he gives Iago the powerful role of lieutenant
<br />
Othello’s sudden grant of power to Iago highlights the global issue of how despite Iago’s originally low ranking, Iago is able to exploit his preferred race as a Venetian and leverage the racism towards Othello perpetuated throughout the play to successfully gain power over Othello’s thoughts and convince him of Desdemona’s infidelity.

# Fields of Inquiry

## Culture, identity, and community

A text we read in class that represents culture, identity, and community is the short story "Blankets" by Sherman Alexie. The blankets in the story are a metaphor for many different ideas, including the role of nostalgia in one's identity and the shared values in the community of First Nations.

**The blankets in the story certainly serve a perfectly normal function, but they're also highly symbolic. What do you think the blankets in the story represent?**

In the story, blankets symbolize protection and comfort. In line 20, the author uses the term "uninsured and unblanketed." Here, blanket refers to the idea of protection, similar to the purpose of insurance. In line 66, the author also uses the term blanket to refer to nostalgia, describing how a woman "had taken nostalgia as her false idol—her thin blanket—and it was murdering her." In this case, the blanket symbolizes how the woman was seeking comfort in nostalgia, how she wished for things to return back to a previous state. However, the author describes the blanket as thin, or in other words, it wasn't doing her much good.

When the author gives his blanket to his father, who then starts to sing, the blanket then symbolizes restoration and faith. The "magical" quality of the blanket being able to heal others is similar to how blankets are able to keep us warm during the night or the cold. In other words, just like how blankets help us get through cold and harsh weather, the symbol of blankets in the story is that faith and song is able to help the author's father get through dark times.

In addition, blankets are also representative of community. In the same way that blankets are often shared between multiple (close) people, the blankets in the story could also symbolize the connection between the tribes.

## Beliefs, values, and education

In Grade 11, I participated in a "round table discussion" about the novel _Frankenstein_ by Mary Shelley. One of the points which I debated in the discussion related to the beliefs and values of each character and relating that to a justification about whether or not the characters could be classified as "right" or "wrong."

**\*Is any one character “right” or “wrong”?**

To answer the question, it makes sense to first define what “right” and “wrong” mean. I would like to define “right” as “being morally good, justified, or acceptable,” and “wrong” as the opposite, or “failing to be morally good, justified, or acceptable.” It’s very difficult to associate an entire character with being “morally good,” since a character can make “right decisions” and “wrong decisions,” and even then, it’s not as straightforward as saying “if a character makes more “right” decisions than “wrong” decisions, then he is a “right” character.” Rather, it makes more sense to associate morals with a character’s actions.

In Paradise Lost, the action in focus is God’s punishment towards Adam for his disobedience. On one hand, we can argue that punishing Adam for his sins is morally right, since God had given Adam paradise and gave him one simple rule that he deliberately disobeyed. However, we could also justify that God’s punishment was morally wrong since it was God who chose to put the temptation of the forbidden fruit in the first place, and that it’s morally unacceptable for God to punish Adam for a sin that God deliberately made possible in the first place.

We can also see this blur between “right” and “wrong” in Frankenstein, where we see Victor’s desire to kill his monster for his crimes. It’s easy to argue that it’s morally right since Victor believes that it would be best for the creature to die before he causes any harm to other humans. However, one can also argue that the creature’s circumstances, established by Victor, forced him into his crime, and thus it wouldn’t be acceptable to take away his life because of the faults that Victor had built into his nature. It’s hard to definitively draw the line of Victor’s actions as being clearly “right” or “wrong,” and doing so has many grander implications beyond this small example. Thus, the actions of a character can both be “right” and “wrong” depending on the perspective and moral values of the judge. In either case, a character’s actions doesn’t make them necessarily a “moral” or an “immoral” character. Thus, we cannot say that any one character is “right” or “wrong,” but we can argue for their actions being “right” or “wrong,” both of which are possible simultaneously under different perspectives.

## Politics, power, and justice

The theme of justice is prevalent in the book _Frankenstein_ by Mary Shelley. To explore this theme, I created a fictional letter written from the perspective of Alphonse, Victor's father, to Victor about the theme of family/parenting and justice.

<div class='px-8 my-2 text-sm'>
  <p>My dear Victor,</p>
  <div class='leading-snug'>
    As I lie on my deathbed, with my sorrowful soul clutching onto its remaining hours on earth, I wish to remind you not of my life, but of yours. My time has come, but it need not mark the end of yours. You have a fruitful future ahead of you, Victor, and you must not forget that. You will attend to cheerful days, filled with the wonders of family and the joys of being a parent. Think not of your past, but of your future children, who shall be innocent and helpless creatures bestowed on you by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot is in your hands to direct to happiness or misery. Spend not your life brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness that you may pass onto your creations.
  </div>
  <div class='leading-snug mt-4'>
    Oh, Victor, if I had known about our fate before I decided to raise a family, I would still choose our family over loneliness in a heartbeat. There’s a special joy in being a parent that you couldn’t find elsewhere, and not even my present sorrows overpower the wonders I experienced because of you and your siblings. Life is precious, Victor, so dwell not on the past, for the past may render you blind to your future. Cherish your children as you would cherish your family. Let not my tragedies fall upon you as a curse. You must not let past evils trouble you and cause you further destruction, but that you may pass on my blessing to your children which I have wholeheartedly passed on to you, as my son. Do not lay my grief upon the heads of your sons and daughters. You must move on from these misfortunes, for they will only hinder you and pull you down like a chain strung around your ankle. Break free, Victor, of this chain, of this grief, of these miseries, and look forth towards the sunrise in pursuit of a better life.
  </div>
  <div class='mt-4'>Your father to his son,</div>
  <div class='mt-0'>Alphonse Frankenstein</div>
</div>

In my RAFT (the name of the assignment), I wanted to explore the theme of family/parenting in Frankenstein. I wanted to touch on the issue of Victor’s lack of proper parenting for the Creature. There seemed to be a great contrast between the familial care Victor had experienced in his childhood with the lack of care he demonstrated towards the Creature. Exploring this contrast highlights Victor’s unfair treatment of him, and how Victor’s grief had rendered him blind to the Creature’s needs for a proper parent and family.

To accomplish this goal, I decided to have Alphonse, Victor’s father, write a letter to Victor shortly before his death. After suffering through both William and Elizabeth’s murder, I wanted Alphonse to inform Victor of the importance of family and the joys of parenting despite the sorrows he had experienced. Alphonse writes about the importance of keeping “feelings of peace and gentleness” as a parent. Victor can be considered a parent of the Creature, and the Creature his child. Victor fails to treat the Creature with gentleness, leading the Creature to turn evil after Victor constantly shows aggression and hate towards him. Alphonse also talks about the great responsibilities that come with being a parent, describing one’s children as “innocent and helpless creatures bestowed on you by heaven” and “whose future lot is in your hands to direct to happiness or misery.” This quote is greatly significant for Victor, since the Creature had started off innocent and helpless, and it is ultimately Victor who directs the Creature to misery by failing to provide the creature with a proper family and parental care. Alphonse also emphasizes the need to move on from the past, telling Victor: “You must not let past evils trouble you and cause you further destruction.” A large reason for Victor’s blindness towards the Creature is his reluctance to forgive the Creature for William’s death, and it is this blindness that leads the Creature to inflict further destruction and misery. Alphonse’s letter acts as a reflection of Victor’s unjust treatment of his Creature, and of his mistakes that ultimately resulted in his downfall.

## Art, creativity, and the imagination

One text we encountered in class that showcases art, creativity, and the imagination was the graphic text "In the Shadow of No Towers" by Art Spiegelman.

**Summarize the literal content of the poem, noting any interesting shifts in tone, structure, or subject matter.**

The graphic text, named “In the Shadow of No Towers,” introduces several different panels indicating various American responses to the 9/11 attacks. In the top left panel, an American family is initially seen asleep in front of the television, and then suddenly becoming shocked at what they see (presumably coverage of the 9/11 attacks). However, in the following panel, they are seen back asleep, but with their hair still frazzled, indicating that only a short time has passed between the second panel and the third. It’s interesting to note that the calendar is covered by an American flag. Below these panels, there is a small series of panels that explain the origin and the definition of the idiom “waiting for the other shoe to drop,” which is used in the bottom middle panel with a shoe falling onto people. Based on the panel, waiting for the other shoe to drop means waiting for an inevitable event to occur that proceeds after an initial event. Below that panel, there is a commentary about how on television, the Twin Towers seem much smaller than they really are. On the sides of the graphic text, there are the two towers and commentary from two different people about the Twin Towers.

**Compose a focus (thesis) statement that addresses on the poem's connections to shared human experience.**

Through the use of symbols, the combination of text and images, and the position and size of the panels in his graphic text “In the Shadow of No Towers,” Art Spiegelman successfully uses the graphic medium to represent and critique the various responses of the American public to the events of 9/11.

**Annotate the poem, noting how the author's structural and stylistic choices (e.g., sound devices, diction, metaphor, etc.) help shape meaning and effect.**

In this graphic text, Art Spiegelman uses symbols, the combination of text and images, and the position and size of the panels to express different American responses to the 9/11 attacks. The symbol of a shoe is prevalent through this text, and it is representative of how loud and controversial news and/or events are considered “normal,” whereas quieter and less controversial events are less well-received. In the comic about the shoe, the noise from dropping the initial shoe doesn’t receive any attention, indicating that it is the expectation. However, when the man silently puts down his other shoe, we can see that the other people in the house are furious with him, expecting him to drop the other shoe. The symbol of the shoe is then repeated at the bottom of the text, where a giant shoe created by “Jihad brand footware” is falling on a crowd of people. In one interpretation, this shoe represents an inevitable event that is expected from the public, which is supported by the series of panels from the right where somebody is worried about a new disaster. This emphasizes how the 9/11 attacks created panic and worry after they occurred.

In addition to the symbol of the shoe, Spiegelman uses the combination of text with the images to better introduce certain ideas. In the panel about the news, he uses the text to provide context for the non-sequitur panels. Through this mini-comic, Spiegelman criticizes the news for failing to depict the event in its true nature. In the last panel, we can see a man staring at the television filled with the US flag and failing to notice the plane crashing into the plane. This is symbolic of how the news fails to properly depict the event.

# Paper 1 Basics

In the HL English Paper 1 exam, you are given 2 hours and 15 minutes to write a guided analysis on two texts. The texts will be of different literary types, including poems, fiction, non-fiction, and extracts from plays.

Based on my experience on the Paper 1 practice exams that we've written in class, it's incredibly important to start writing _as soon as possible._ The time constraint on this exam is extremely tight, and if you spend too much time trying to analyze the passage, you'll run out of time before you can flush out your ideas. Thus, I find it better to analyze the text as I go instead of analyzing it ahead of time and organizing my ideas.

In addition, a strategy that I've found useful when writing Paper 1 exams is to leave a blank space after every paragraph. This is so that if you ever have more ideas that you end up thinking about later, you'll be able to use the extra space to insert those ideas.

It's also important to remember to quote the text as much as possible to support your claims. You need to provide evidence from the extract in order to gain full marks for your analysis. One useful question to ask yourself whenever you're analyzing a text is "why did the author use these specific words/wording?"

# Vocabulary Associated with Each Literary Form

<div class='mt-5'></div>

### Drama

**Aside:** Words spoken by an actor directly to the audience, but not "heard" by the other characters
on stage during a play.

**Dramatic Irony:** A device in which a character holds a position or has an expectation reversed or fulfilled in a way that the character did not expect but that the audience or readers have anticipated because their knowledge of events or individuals is more complete than the
character’s.

<div class='mt-5'></div>

### Fiction

**Characterization:** The methods the author uses to reveal a "character" to a reader (e.g. their values, beliefs, goals, etc.) Can be direct (a fact explicitly given about a character such as "they are tall") or indirect (an action/attribute that implicitly characterizes a character, such as "his friend needed to look up to make eye contact with him" -> implies the friend is tall).

**Plot:** The sequence of events and actions that make up a story. Typically consists of the following 5 parts:

1. Exposition: The beginning where characters/setting is introduced
2. Rising action: The main character experiences a series of events which build up to a major conflict (the climax).
3. Climax: The peak of the story where the main character faces a major conflict.
4. Falling Action: The story starts to slow down and conflicts begin to become resolved.
5. Denouement: The end of the story where loose ends are tied up.

<div class='mt-5'></div>

### Non-fiction

**Pathos:** Appealing to emotion to draw out feelings like pity or anger.

_Example:_ "If we don't move soon, we're all going to die! Can't you see how dangerous it would be to stay?"

**Rhetorical question:** A question asked in order to create dramatic effect or to make a point rather than to receive an answer.

_Example:_ "Must I argue the wrongfulness of slavery? Is that a question for republicans? Is it to be settled by the rules of logic and argumentation, as a matter beset with great difficulty, involving a doubtful application of the principle of justice, hard to understand?" (Frederick Douglass, "What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?" July 5, 1852)

## My Blog (coming soon)

I've been wanting to start a blog for a while now (fun fact: I started a blog in Grade 9 which lasted 6 months before I discontinued it). I have a lot of unconventional ideas when it comes to topics like productivity and fulfillment in life that (as of now) only my friends currently know about. And sometimes, I use my programming skills to build experimental projects related to these ideas. I would love to share these ideas and projects with the world, and with a month left before IB ends, I'll have time to re-continue writing blog posts about my ideas.

# Advice for Managing Stress & Wellbeing

In my opinion, the best way to manage stress is by creating a concrete plan for your day/week/month using a strategy like Timeblocking. Timeblocking involves dividing your day into chunks of time that are each dedicated to a single task. This way, you give each minute of your day a specific purpose. Timeblocking helps with managing stress because a lot of the stress many people experience comes from the lack of a concrete plan. When you lack a plan, your brain does not trust that you will be able to complete a task or a project, leading to unnecessary stress that negatively impacts your productivity.

As for wellbeing, an idea I've recently been thinking about is the prioritization between consumption-oriented activities and production-oriented activities. Consumption-oriented activities include playing video games, watching videos, and listening to music; activities that mainly involve consuming content for your own benefit. In contrast, production-oriented activities include writing a novel, working on a project, or volunteering; activities that mainly involve producing things that either produce something new and physical in the real world or bring significant value to others. I believe that our society is placing too much emphasis on consumption-oriented content, *especially* with the advent of social media. I personally have very negative opinions on the use of social media and similar platforms whose business model depends on you spending your valuable time consuming content. I believe that in the long run, it's impossible to gain fulfillment from consumption-oriented activities; it's impossible to live a fulfilling live only consuming content created by others and not producing anything valuable of your own. While consumption-oriented activities may make us happy in the short run, they can't bring us fulfillment in life in the long run.

Thus, I've recently been focused on helping people adopt a more production-oriented mindset where they strive to take on tasks or projects that end with them producing a physical artifact that brings something new in the world, whether it's writing a journal entry every night or starting a personal project applying the skills that you've acquired throughout your four years of high school.

Of course, I'm not claiming that all consumption-oriented activities are bad, but I believe that for many of us, the balance between consumption and production is much too biased towards the consumption end. I think that for managing our wellbeing, spending more time on production-oriented activities can make a substantial difference, especially as production-oriented activities help bring "meaning to your life" where you're bringing something new into the world in contrast to consumption-oriented activities.

# Final Reflection - Personal Strengths, Areas for Growth, and Areas _of_ Growth

In English, I find myself to be pretty strong at generating ideas and intepreting texts. During pair discussions in class, I notice that I often come up with many solid ideas after reading texts and I am able to verbally explain to my friend. However, when it comes to writing down these ideas during a Paper 1, I find it much more difficult to brainstorm similar ideas under the tight time constraints of a Paper 1. In addition, I find it difficult in general to motivate myself to write down longform ideas on paper; I prefer to brainstorm and think out loud.

One of my areas _of_ growth in English during the past two years is my public speaking/presentation abilities. During my Choice Board Presentation, I found myself a lot more confident presenting in front of the class (although I still need to work on slowing down my speaking speed). As somebody who is interested in entrepreneurship, mastering public speaking is incredibly crucial as I will need to be able to clearly articulate my ideas as when pitching my ideas to investors and businesses.
