# Areas Of Exploration

## Readers, writers and texts

<!--
  Briefly answer the following questions:
  Why and how do we study language and literature?
  How are we affected by texts in various ways?
  In what ways is meaning constructed, negotiated, expressed and interpreted?
  How does language use vary amongst text types and amongst literary forms?
  How does the structure or style of a text affect meaning?
  How do texts offer insights and challenges?
-->
<!-- Write about How Poems See, How Poems Sound -->

<!-- TODO: write a bit about how this related with the stuff I did in ETS4U7 -->

## Time and space

<!-- How important is cultural or historical context to the production and reception of a text?​ -->

When reading texts, we need to consider the cultural and historical context in order to better understand the writer's intentions. In our course, a good example of a text that benefits from an understanding of the cultural and historical context is Things Fall Apart. Chinua Achebe wrote *Things Fall Apart* in response to the way European literature depicted African culture, especially in Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*.

<!-- To what extent do texts offer insight into another culture? -->
Things Fall Apart also gives the reader insight into African culture from a post-colonial lens. In Things Fall Apart, the reader learns about African culture from the inside. The reader is exposed to African traditions and beliefs from a clan member's point of view, and gains a new perspective on how Europeans were viewed from the context of an African clan.

<!-- How do texts reflect, represent or form a part of cultural practices? -->

<!-- How does language represent social distinctions and identities? -->

## Intertextuality

<!-- Talk about The Songlines -->

<!-- In what ways can diverse texts share points of similarity? -->
<!-- How can texts offer multiple perspectives of a single issue, topic or theme? -->
Intertextuality deals with the relationship between different texts. In our course, one text that alluded to multiple other texts was *The Songlines* by Bruce Chatwin. In the extract that we used for a practice Paper 2, Chatwin discusses his thoughts about the nature of human restlessness. When offering alternative perpsectives, he alludes to *Pens\@ees*, a work written by the philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal, who offers a hypothesis based on philosophy, concluding that human restlessness is a negative characteristic. After expanding on Pascal's explanation, Chatwin offers an alternative perspective based on scientific evidence. By referencing Pascal's work, Chatwin exposes the reader to multiple different intepretations of the topic, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the issue.

<!--
  Briefly answer the following:
  How do texts adhere to and deviate from conventions associated with literary forms or text types?
  How do conventions and systems of reference evolve over time?
  How valid is the notion of a classic text?
  In what ways can comparison and interpretation be transformative?
-->

# IB Concepts

<!-- see https://www.cambridge.org/us/education/blog/2019/07/25/7-key-concepts-english-language-and-literature-ib-diploma/ -->

## Identity

<!-- To what extent is a text an expression of a writer’s identity? Do readers like characters who are thinly veiled versions of themselves? Do strong characters challenge readers to be someone different? By analysing texts, we are really analysing who we are and what we want to become. -->

The IB concept of identity is prevelant in Persepolis, an autobiographical graphic novel detailing Marjane Satrapi's childhood in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. The protagonist in the novel is based off of the author, Marjane, and is written in a honest way reflective of people in the real-world. In this way, readers are able to relate with the main character and feel closely connected with them. In addition, the reader is able to see Marjane grow as a person throughout the novel.

# Image 1

In this panel, Satrapi creates a contrast between religious beliefs and modern beliefs. The panel contains narration, where Satrapi describes her self-conflict about the veil. She discusses how there are two parts of herself which are in conflict with each other: while she is deep down a very religion person, her family was very modern and avant-garde, which means that they favour experimental and unusual ideas. These parts of herself are in conflict because religion is ultimately tied to tradition and is often hesitant to change, rejecting experimental and unusual ideas in favour of traditional ideas.

Satrapi also uses the visual medium of the comic to convey this conflict. The left side of the panel contains gears and tools, symbols that represent science, a subject which is concrete and based on proof and objectivity. In contrast, the right side of the panel contains a very abstract drawing, which is a symbol for religion, a subject which is very abstract and relies on faith and often interpretation. In addition, both of these halves are equal in size, which emphasizes how the narrator was extremely divided about these topics, and didn't know which side of herself she should prefer.

In addition, Satrapi also draws herself wearing two different outfits on the different halves of the panel. On the left side, she draws herself without the veil, representing the modern side of her family. On the right side, she draws herself wearing the veil, representing her side which was very religious. The salient image in this panel is her face, as it is the only part of the image that doesn't change between the two halves. The expression on her face is significant because it doesn't display any visiblly strong emotion, indicating that this conflict is primarily a personal and internal conflict.

## Culture

## Creativity

<!--
  The Affair poem, also include my poem I created

  Why do writers write? Why do artists create? How do writers make creative choices to construct meaning? Where does creativity come from? And what’s the reader’s role in creating meaning? Creativity is a defining characteristic of human beings. By analysing works of creativity, we are studying what it means to be human.
-->

A text we read in our course that is representative of creativity is "The Affair" by Alan Riddell:

<img src='/assets/the-affair.png' width='300' />

This is a "Poem Without Words"

I think this poem is about a relationship between a man and a woman. I read the poem left to right, top to bottom. Through this method of reading, the speaker initially uses only the letter “i”, which likely refers to the pronoun “i” that represents the speaker alone. In the next line, the speaker introduces a letter “u” in the middle of the line, which likely represents the female that the speaker encounters. In the next few lines, there are many more “u”s which symbolize the female being more present in the speaker’s life. However, near the middle of the poem, the number of “u”s starts to decrease, potentially symbolizing that the female starts becoming more distant from the speaker. Finally, in the last line, there is only the letter “i”s again, likely indicating that the speaker is once again alone and without the woman in her life. Based on the title, it likely represents a short-lived affair between a man and a woman. And when the poem is looked as at a whole, the letter u’s form both a diamond, or a square missing a center (depending on how you look at it). If the shape is interpreted as a square missing a center, this “missing” part of the square could represent a “hole” in the speaker’s life now that the woman has left him. If the shape is interpreted as a diamond, since diamonds generally represent riches, it could possibly mean that the woman, the “u”, was wealthy compared to the speaker, and could be the reason why the woman eventually left him.

Here's my take on a Poem Without Words:
